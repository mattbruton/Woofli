# woof.li

This is my final capstone project at Nashville Software School for Evening Cohort 3. woof.li aides users in keeping track of their pets medication needs by emailing or texting reminders when medication is due. If the pet is with a pet sitter, the sitter receives the notification instead of the pet's owner.

I am currently working out some issue with the project that are keeping me from deploying it to Azure and should have them resolved soon. The project works locally outside of the Email/SMS application, as you would need an API key from the services being used.
